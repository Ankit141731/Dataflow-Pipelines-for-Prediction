# DataFlow Prediction Pipeline
### Project Overview
The DataFlow Prediction Pipeline is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict [specific outcome]. The pipeline is built using a modular approach that enables efficient data flow management, streamlined data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. It leverages cutting-edge tools like Streamlit, Docker, and Python to ensure scalability, maintainability, and robust predictions.

### Features
Modular Code Structure: Each component of the pipeline is written in a modular format, allowing easy updates, debugging, and maintenance.
Prediction Capabilities: Uses machine learning algorithms for prediction of [specific outcome].
Deployment via Streamlit: The entire model is deployed on Streamlit for real-time interaction and result visualization.
Dockerized Application: The project is containerized using Docker to ensure portability and seamless deployment across environments.
Pipeline for Data Management: A robust pipeline for managing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
### Technologies Used
Python: Primary language for scripting and model development.
Streamlit: Framework for building the user interface for real-time predictions.
Docker: To containerize the application and ensure consistent performance across environments.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Pandas, Numpy: For data manipulation and transformation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data and results.
### Installation
Prerequisites:
Python >= 3.x
Docker (optional but recommended for deployment)
### Steps to Run Locally:
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataFlow-Prediction-Pipeline.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd DataFlow-Prediction-Pipeline
